- fork ini package and allow adding sections to the top (rather than bottom)
	- although, not an issue if config for recipe and packages are different.
	- Maybe replace with - https://github.com/go-ini/ini
- run abitary shell commands on archived file after it has downloaded
	- just add copy and chmod and maybe chown commands
- logging
	- adding verbose

- Doen't take into account available <os>_<arch>
	- Don't care, can remove code
- Concurrency when downloading packages
- cli add <recipe> <full_url>
    - this could extract the relevant version, arch and os infor from the url and create a new recipe?
    - not sure if possible..?

- run abitary shell commands on archived file after it has downloaded
    - Need to know the files before hand because currently everything is done in-memory and only binaries are written to disk
    - protoc could move the include directories to relevated locations
    - should have string interpolation
