- pathsToCheck:
    - change name?
    - should be overrideable in each recipe
- run abitary shell commands on archived file after it has downloaded
    - Need to know the files before hand because currently everything is done in-memory and only binaries are written to disk
    - protoc could move the include directories to relevated locations
    - should have string interpolation
- Concurrency when downloading packages
- logging
- make it a cli program
- should be able ot take arbitrary pacman config file
- should be able to version a recipe better
- cli status / version
    - shows currently installed locations and version
- cli update <recipe> <version>
    - this should add the pacmconfig and re-run
- cli rollback <recipe> <version>
    - rollback to previous version?
- cli add <recipe> <full_url>
    - this could extract the relevant version, arch and os infor from the url and create a new recipe?
    - not sure if possible..?

# This seems a better way to handle this recipes and versions
- maybe split recipes and versions apart:
    - A recipe can be the url
    - a version can be the version, os and arch.
    - Recipes can be a [recipe <name>] in the pacmconfig or alternatively load from somewhere on disk?
    - a section in pacmconfig can use recipe=<name> to use that recipe

- validate that the arch and os are the same as GOOS and GOARCH
