- "upgrade" to "latest" by checking downloads:
	- should ask for stable or prelease
	- or, default to stable, but pre-release flag to download non-stable
- "list-updates" should remove 'v' from version;
	- however, this should only happen if the recipe url doesn't need it, no idea how to deal with that.
		- Possibly change the 'update' command to try without the 'v', likely easier
- "list-updates" should show error if missing from path, even if it isn't in verbose mode!
- Doen't take into account available <os>_<arch>
- Add back in checksums
- sorting by sem-var doesn't work correctly, "terraform@v0.0.2" will rank higher than "terraform@v0.0.11"

- run abitary shell commands on archived file after it has downloaded
###########################################################

- Add built-in recipe packages
- Add a configurable recipe path for when looking for recipes
- Concurrency when downloading packages
- logging
- cli add <recipe> <full_url>
    - this could extract the relevant version, arch and os infor from the url and create a new recipe?
    - not sure if possible..?

- run abitary shell commands on archived file after it has downloaded
    - Need to know the files before hand because currently everything is done in-memory and only binaries are written to disk
    - protoc could move the include directories to relevated locations
    - should have string interpolation
