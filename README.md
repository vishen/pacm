# Pacm

Simple package manager for managing binary applications. A simple ini config is 
used to declare what packages should be installed and managed. `pacm` won't 
attempt to add itself to your PATH, this will need to be done manually.

`pacm` works with a single config file. This config file can declare packages and 
recipes. A `recipe` is a definition for where to download the `recipe` from and
how to extract the `recipe`. A `package` is a combination of `recipe` and a version
of that recipe: `<recipe>@<version`. These can be defined in your config file.

## Recipes

Some default ones can be found at https://github.com/vishen/pacm-recipes.

New recipes can be added to your config file and will take precendence
over recipes from any remote recipes.

## Config

Will by default look for a config path at `~/.config/pacm/config`.

```ini
dir=/some/path/on/disk

[terraform@0.12.0-rc1]
	active=true
[terraform@0.11.13]

[protoc@3.8.0-rc1]
	active=true
[protoc@3.7.1]

[kubectl@1.15.0-alpha.1]
[kubectl@1.14.2]
	active=true
```

`dir` indicates which directory to install binaries to. This will
need to be added to your path.

`[<recipe>@<version>]` where `recipe` is a `[recipe <name>]` declared
somewhere in a config file (ie: https://github.com/vishen/pacm-recipes/blob/e22e9659bfdaee20ade7a1654753c05a41597426/kubectl/recipe.ini).

## Installing

	go get -u github.com/vishen/pacm

## Running

Make sure that you have added the `dir` path to you PATH, otherwise
you won't have the installed binaries available to you.

When running `pacm activate` and `pacm update`, your ini config
will be overwritten to reflect the changes you have made.

```
# Ensure that your config file and what is installed on disk is correct.
